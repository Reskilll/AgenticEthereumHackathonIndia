## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *“[Scholarship scmas]”*  
Current verification systems are plagued by privacy concerns, rampant fraud, and the inefficiencies of manual validation. These challenges lead to delays, inaccuracies, and a lack of trust in the system. It is essential to address these issues to ensure secure and reliable verification for all students.

## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* [EduRaksha Agent]  
- *Decentralized Verification*: Authorities issue signed digital credentials (e.g., caste, income, marks) stored in students’ Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) wallets.
- *Privacy via ZKPs*: Students prove eligibility (e.g., “income < ₹1,00,000”) using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) without revealing sensitive data.
- *Blockchain Trust*: Ethereum with ENS verifies issuer trust; smart contracts ensure tamper-proof, automated validation.
- *Multilingual AI Chatbot*: LLAMA-powered AI supports regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil), using NLP to guide non-technical users via text or voice.
- *Benefits*: Protects privacy, prevents fraud, reduces verification delays, and enhances accessibility for diverse linguistic groups.
- *Tech Stack*: Ethereum, Polygon ID, Stomo Connect, Solidity, Hardhat, React, Ollama, and multilingual NLP models (e.g., XLM-RoBERTa).
- *Future Impact*: Scalable globally, promotes education equity, and sets a standard for secure, inclusive verification.
