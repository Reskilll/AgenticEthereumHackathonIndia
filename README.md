## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

UI/UX (Figma): Designed for low-literacy users with voice-first, intuitive, and culturally contextual interfaces.
Frontend (HTML, Tailwind, React): Mobile-first, responsive UI accessible on low-end devices across rural regions.
Backend (Node.js / Python Flask): Powers real-time crop diagnostics, user actions, and expert interactions.
AI/ML (Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Hugging Face, Google Cloud Voice): Enables disease detection via images, regional-language voice assistant, and smart crop recommendations.
AgriCreds (JS + Points DB): Farmers share tips or questions, and others vote on that post. Helpful posts earn AgriCreds, which can be used for expert advice from agronomists.
Payment Integration (UPI / Razorpay API): Seamless redemption of AgriCreds for certified seeds or bio-inputs.
Database (MongoDB / Firebase): Secure and scalable farmer profiles, activity logs, and crop health records.
